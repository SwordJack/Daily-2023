## BallsFromBoxes

This directory is created due to the following question:

```txt
三个完全相同的盒子，一个盒子里面装了两个红球，一个盒子里面装了两个蓝球，一个盒子里面装了一个红球一个蓝球。
从三个盒子中随机选择了一个盒子，从里面拿出了一个球发现是红色的，问这个盒子里剩下的那个球是红色的概率有多大？

There are three identical boxes, one box contains two red balls, one box contains two blue balls, and one box contains one red ball and one blue ball.
A box is randomly selected from three boxes, a ball is taken out from it and it is red, what is the probability that the remaining ball in this box is red?
```

Thus, in order to confirm the answer, I composed the script in this directory.
